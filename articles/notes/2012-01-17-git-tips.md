# Git tips

## Tricks commands

### Move commits between branchs


```bash
git checkout master
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
// Will output something like that
024b34d [Cookbook] Create Desk cookbook
0b16310 [Role] Desk server
0c19a4b [Vagrant] Add desk_server role
4a9fdbe [Role] Add redis_server role
3f7db8f [Cookbook] Add recipe for redis in the cookbook hipsnip_firewall
// Now we want to move commit 024b34d and 0b16310 to the dev branch
git checkout dev
git cherry-pick 0b16310
git cherry-pick 024b34d
git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

### Undo last commit

```bash
git reset --soft file HEAD~1
```

### Undo a reset

```bash
git reflog
// Will output something like that
1d71c0a HEAD@{0}: HEAD~1: updating HEAD
170b882 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from node_v6 to master
170b882 HEAD@{2}: HEAD~1: updating HEAD
059c7a5 HEAD@{3}: commit: FIX: Remove all listeners on the end event.
170b882 HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from master to node_v6
170b882 HEAD@{5}: commit: RELEASE: v0.0.3
1d71c0a HEAD@{6}: commit: FIX: Add function oncdata() to listen on the event "cd
92ba8e2 HEAD@{7}: commit: the format and validation functions are also applied t
// Now I want to come back where my HEAD has the following commit message: "RELEASE: v0.0.3"
git reset --soft 170b882
```

### Delete local branch

```bash
git branch -D branch
```

### Delete remote branch

```bash
git push origin :branch
```
### When .gitignore file is not ignoring files, do

```bash
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m 'FIX: files are now ignored thanks to .gitignore'
```

## Work on a remote branch locally

```bash
git checkout -b local-name origin/remote-name
```

An error maybe?
>fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.
>Did you intend to checkout 'origin/remote-name' which can not be resolved as commit?

```bash
git remote show origin
```

If the remote branch you want to checkout is under "New remote branches" and not "Tracked remote branches" then you need to fetch them first:

```bash
git remote update
git checkout -b local-name origin/remote-name
```
